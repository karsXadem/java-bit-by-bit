Package Description: controlflow

This package contains examples of control flow in Java programming.
It includes basic structures like conditional statements (if-else, switch-case)
and loops (for, while, do-while) to demonstrate how to control the flow of execution
within a program. The examples provided are ideal for beginners and intermediate
learners to understand the fundamental concepts of Java control flow.
